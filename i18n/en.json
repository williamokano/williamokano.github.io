    "title": "About",
    "p1": "I grew up in Brazil, studied Computer Science at Universidade Federal de Uberlândia, and started writing code professionally before I could legally rent a car. That was over fifteen years ago. Since then, I have worked across fintech, food delivery, and productivity tooling — building systems that serve millions of users and mentoring the engineers who maintain them.",
    "p2": "My path took me from Brazil to Berlin, where I have spent the last several years working at companies like N26 Bank, Delivery Hero, and Grammarly. At each stop, the pattern has been the same: I dig into the hard backend problems, push for clean and maintainable solutions, and make sure the people around me have what they need to do their best work.",
    "p3": "I am a backend engineer at heart — Go, Kotlin, JVM, distributed systems — but I am comfortable moving across the stack when the problem calls for it. What matters to me is not the language or the framework. It is whether we are building something that works well, reads well, and will still make sense six months from now when someone else opens the pull request."
